This text is part of an ongoing research and writing project.

This repository collects notes, articles, and early explorations related to
software engineering and data analysis applied to motorsport and racing simulation.

The goal is not to build a finished product immediately, but to:
- understand how data is used in motorsport contexts
- explore software design choices for analysis tools
- connect theoretical computer science with applied motorsport problems

## Contents

- [articles](\article\README.md) 
  Drafts and published versions of technical articles.

- [notes](\notes\README.md)
  Technical notes, diagrams, and reflections on telemetry, data, and software design.

- [idea](idea.md)  
  Open questions and topics to explore.

## Status

This repository is a work in progress and evolves together with ongoing study and writing.
